## EVA-8 Assignment 5

### Problem Statement

1. You are making 3 versions of your 4th assignment's best model (or pick one from best assignments):
Network with Group Normalization
Network with Layer Normalization
Network with L1 + BN

#### You MUST:
1. Write a single model.py file that includes GN/LN/BN and takes an argument to decide which normalization to include
2. Write a single notebook file to run all the 3 models above for 20 epochs each
Create these graphs:
    Graph 1: Test/Validation Loss for all 3 models together
    Graph 2: Test/Validation Accuracy for 3 models together
    graphs must have proper annotation
3. Find 10 misclassified images for each of the 3 models, and show them as a 5x2 image matrix in 3 separately annotated images. 
4. write an explanatory README file that explains:
    what is your code all about,
    how to perform the 3 normalizations techniques that we covered(cannot use values from the excel sheet shared)
    your findings for normalization techniques,
    add all your graphs
    your 3 collection-of-misclassified-images 



### Solution

#### model.py:
1. This is the main module that contains the code for the Model Definition.
2. This module contains the 3 classes:
    LayerNormCNN
    GroupNormCNN
    BatchNormCNN
3. This module also contains ```get_model()``` function that takes the ```normalization``` argument and creates the CNN model with corresponding Normalization technique.


#### train_helper.py
1. This is the helper module that contains the following:
    1. ```BN_Trainer:``` This class contains the train and test method that has been written
    exclusively for the Batch Normalization + L1 Regulization.
    2. ```Trainer:``` This class contains the train and test methods that can be used for 
    LayerNormalization and GroupNormalization.
2. ```get_misclassified_images```: this method takes the model and test_loader and generates the mis-classified images.
